I made a video for the [2104 UC Global Health Day Video Challenge](http://www.ucghi.universityofcalifornia.edu/news-events/uc-global-health-day/2014/video-contest-winners.aspx), organized by the The UC Global Health Institute (UCGHI), whose mission is to “improve the lives of people in California and around the world”.

It won first place, and I present it here before you :)
