I made a video for the [2104 UC Global Health Day Video Challenge](http://www.ucghi.universityofcalifornia.edu/news-events/uc-global-health-day/2014/video-contest-winners.aspx), organized by the The UC Global Health Institute (UCGHI), whose mission is to “improve the lives of people in California and around the world”.

It was centered on my experiences at the COP15 climate change talks in Copenhagen, a pivotal point in my life because it stirred a deep yearning to utilize my science background while serving our planet. It got me searching online for what I, as a vet, could do...and brought me to the One Health Institute here at UC Davis. The video ended up winning first prize, and I'm sharing it here if you'd like to see just what it is about global health that's so inspiring.
