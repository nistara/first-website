For scientific writing Math is essential. That is why I added [Mathjax](http://www.mathjax.org/) to render all your beautiful equations inline, $ f(x) = a x^\alpha $, or as blocked equation element

$$ J_\alpha(x) = \sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \, \Gamma(m + \alpha + 1)}{\bigl({\frac{x}{2}}\bigr)}^{2 m + \alpha} $$

Have fun!
