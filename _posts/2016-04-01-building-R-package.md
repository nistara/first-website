I made this post for a short talk on building and documenting your own R packages for the Davis R-users' group. It'll get you started on making basic R packages, and once you get the flavor of what it's all about, you can unleash your own inner R genie to create your own tools!

The tools you're going to need for this are:

- R packages
    * devtools - to easily create and publish your package on github
    * roxygen2 - for easy documentation of your package
    *
