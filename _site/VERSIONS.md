# jekyll-lablog Version history

## v0.2  (22.03.2015)

After a while of leaving the project at rest, I finally push some features that I already developed a while ago, into version 0.2 of the jekyll-lablog template.

It's major advancements are:

- new **typeset using Open Sans and minimalist icons** (compiled using [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)).
- a dark, **responsive menu**. It smartly provides direct links to all pages or posts that have a `menu:` variable specified in their yml header.
- revised **footer**, including links and icons and an RSS/Atom feed
- manage your **projects** using a layout file that collects all content that has a specific **tag**.
- automatically **collapse completed tasks** (toggle switch will follow)
- enable **multiple tasklists**, that are compiled into a long one
