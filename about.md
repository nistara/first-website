I am a PhD candidate in the graduate group of Epidemiology. I'm just starting on creating this site to keep track of things like R code snipptes, etc that help me with my PhD project (and beyond). My background is that of a Veterinarian, though I am keen on amalgamating my Veterinary and Epidemiology knowledge with programming...so please bear with me as I find my way in this world of github, jekyll, programming, and contributing positively to this planet! 

As of now, I am working on spatial analyses of infectious agents, and developing tools to help my research group manipulate project data.

I will update this site incrementally, so that I can balance it with my ongoing PhD work.

This site was started as a clone from Florian Schneider's [Jekyll-lablog](https://github.com/fdschneider/jekyll-lablog). 

Oh, and I love horses. They're what got me started on my Veterinary path. However, these days I find myself behind a laptop rather than on a horse. Which is fine...because I love this work as well!
